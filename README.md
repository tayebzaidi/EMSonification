# Electromagnetic Sonification

This repository contains two files. First, a csv file containing results from a set of frequency sweeps acquired using the HackRF One (Great Scott Gadgets) software defined radio and the [soapy_power](https://github.com/xmikos/soapy_power) utility. The second is an Ipython notebook containing the software for loading the frequency sweeps and converting them to an audio output.
